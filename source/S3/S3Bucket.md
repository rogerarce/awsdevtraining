    - 99.9 availability
    - 99.9^11 durability
    - Tiered Storage Available
    - Lifecycle Management

    - Ecryption
    - Secure data
        - control list
        - access policy

            - subresources
                - bucket policies
                - access control list
                - cross origin resource sharing (cors)
                - transfer acceleration
- ## Store Tier/Classes
    - s3: 99.9 availability & 99.9^11 durability
        - stored redundantly across multiple devices
    - S3 - IA (Infrequent Accessed)
        - for data accessed less frequently
        - but requires rapid access when needed
        - lower fee
        - charge on retrieval fee
    - s3 - One Zone IA
        - store in single AZ
        - offeres 99.5% availability
        - Cost is 20% less than regular s3 - IA.
    - Reduced Redundancy Storage
        - Designed to provided 99.9% durability & availability
        - for data that can be recreated if lost.
        - not offered in some region
        - not recommeded
        - possible phase out.
    - Glacier
        - very cheap
        - for archiving
        - optimised for data infrequently accessed
        - 3 - 5 hrs to restore
- ## Access S3 Bucket via EC2 Instance
    - Create IAM user for aws instance
    - ssh to EC2 Instance
    - configure aws account via terminal
        - `aws configure`
        - add access_key & secret_access_key
