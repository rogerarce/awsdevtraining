# AWS Lambda
- A compute service where you can upload your code and create lambda function.
- Lambda takes care of provisioning and managing the servers
- As an event-driven compute service, triggers
- Compute service to run your code in response to HTTP (API Gateway)

- ## Basic
    - lambda func can trigger other lambda func.
    - languages
        - nodejs
        - java
        - python
        - c#
        - go
    - Pricing
        - First 1 million requests are free (per month).
        - $0.20 per 1 million requests.
        - Duration
    - Features
        - No servers
        - Continuous Scaling
        - Cheap
- ## API
    - Application Programming Interface
    - Types
        - REST API (representational State Transfer)
        - SOAP API's (Simple Object Access Protocol) (xml)
    - API Gateway
        - full manage service
        - makes it easy to maintain monitor publish and secure api at any scale.
        - Expose http endpoint to define restful api's
        - Serverlessly connect to services like Lambda & DynamoDB
        - Send each API endpoint to a different target
        - Run efficiently with low cost
        - Scale Effortlessly
        - Track and control usage by api key
        - Throttle requests to prevent attacks
        - Connect to cloudwatch to log all requests for monitoring
    - Configuration
        - Define an api
        - Define Resources and nested Resources
        - For each Resources
            - Select supported http methods
            - Set security
            - Choose target
            - Set Request and response transformation
        - Deploy Api to a stage
            - uses api gateway domain
            - can use custom domain
            - supports aws certificate manager. free ssl/tls certs
    - API Caching
        - cache endpoint response
        - reduce number of calls made to endpoint
        - improve request latency
        - specify ttl for cached requests
        - responds by looking up the endpoint response
        - cache instead of making requests
- ## Same Origin Policy
    - same origin policy
- ## Cross Origin Request S
